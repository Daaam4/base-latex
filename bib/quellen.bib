ABSTRACT = {Collaborative Model-based Systems Engineering between companies is becoming increasingly important. The utilization of the modeling possibilities of the standard language SysML v2 and the multilateral data exchange via Dataspaces open new possibilities for efficient collaboration. Based on systemic approaches, a modeling concept for decomposing the system into sub-systems is developed as a basis for the exchange. In addition, based on the analysis of collaboration processes in the context of Systems Engineering, an architectural approach with a SysML editor and Dataspace for the exchange is elaborated. The architecture is implemented on the basis of open-source solutions. The investigations are based on an application example from precision engineering. The potential and challenges are discussed.},

Note = "This paper explores how to enable collaborative, multi-company MBSE by combining SysML v2 modeling with a secure framework for data exchange. The proposed solution relies on a modeling guideline to maintain consistency and interoperability, which is why its relevant as it justifies why standardized guidelines are essential for leveraging SysML v2's new features in a collaborative, multi-tool environment."

note ="This paper investigates the critical challenge of managing model consistency across multiple, heterogeneous viewpoints in MBSE. It analyzes existing approaches against a set of industrial requirements, identifying significant gaps in current methods. This work is essential as it defines the problem of inconsistency that new, formalized SysML v2 guidelines are intended to solve, thereby motivating Hypotheses 1 and 2."

  note = "This paper argues that SysML v2's abstract, general-purpose nature creates a high risk of inconsistent modeling, making reuse impossible . It proposes a new, formal set of guidelines using SysML v2's native action, part, and metadata features. This source is a cornerstone as it provides a direct example of new formal guidelines and structures."

The method programmatically derives validation rules directly from metamodels to automatically detect both syntactic and semantic inconsistencies. This work is essential as it provides direct proof for the the hypothesis."
