ABSTRACT = {Collaborative Model-based Systems Engineering between companies is becoming increasingly important. The utilization of the modeling possibilities of the standard language SysML v2 and the multilateral data exchange via Dataspaces open new possibilities for efficient collaboration. Based on systemic approaches, a modeling concept for decomposing the system into sub-systems is developed as a basis for the exchange. In addition, based on the analysis of collaboration processes in the context of Systems Engineering, an architectural approach with a SysML editor and Dataspace for the exchange is elaborated. The architecture is implemented on the basis of open-source solutions. The investigations are based on an application example from precision engineering. The potential and challenges are discussed.},

Note = "This paper explores how to enable collaborative MBSE by combining SysML v2 modeling with a secure framework for data exchange. The proposed solution relies on a modeling guideline to maintain consistency and interoperability, which is why its relevant as it justifies why standardized guidelines are essential for leveraging SysML v2's new features in a collaborative, multi-tool environment."
